This is not a bug. First of all, there's no 'default' user in Fedora, and it would be unreasonable and insecure to expect VirtualBox to manage user groups on a Guest OS.

If you want to add a user to a group in Fedora, do the following:

Open a terminal.
> sudo usermod -a -G vboxsf <username>
You may have to reboot to remount the share, the easiest way to do this is probably to reboot the VM.
